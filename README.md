# This Month's Talk:
**If you would like to speak as well, then you absolutely can. Ask [@dc44141](https://twitter.com/dc44141). We also accept unannounced talks where you just get up without fanfare, and have had a few do it that way in the heat of the moment.**

## Ethos 

DC44141 is free. It is free to attend. It is free to talk at. It is free of commercial sponsorship. 

It is welcoming. The only thing NOT tolerated is intolerance; if you see something, say something.

## Organisers

Volunteers run it on a happily chaotic basis. To my knowledge, there has never been a committee meeting or anything. These reprobates are generally involved, though:

* [@ZephrFish](https://twitter.com/ZephrFish) - Mostly been the face for years if we are honest and continue to run, good luck catching me ;) 
* [@Rab_Ray](https://twitter.com/Rab_Ray) & [@PMason00](https://twitter.com/PMason00)(You will be missed pal, rest in peace) - Also founding fathers along with ZephrFish.
* [@cornerpirate](https://twitter.com/cornerpirate) - regular content provider, failing upwards to a bit of organising in 2020 since nobody cared to stop me.

-- note to the editor. If I missed anyone then sorry, my excuse is I wasn't around when DC44141 sparked into existence.

## FAQs - In Person back this Dec 2022 ðŸ˜Š
### Is there any food or drink?

The event is entirely free and is not sponsored so there is no food or drink provided. 

The venue has a [food menu]([https://github.com/dc44141/dc44141.github.io/raw/master/images/food-menu.jpg](https://www.theravenglasgow.com/menus/)). Food stops being served at 8pm ish so if you plan on eating get in early and get your order in. 

### Can I get an Invite to Discord please?
